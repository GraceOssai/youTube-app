    Element is a generic term used to describe anything we display on the web page.
    Syntax are the rules for which html elements are written. If the rules are not followed, our codes will not be displayed.

   <button>Click Me </button>
   <!-- 
    From the button above, the button is called the TAG NAME. A complete html element must have the complete syntax which includes the greater than and less than symbols, opening tag and the closing tag. Please note that the closing tag must have a forward slash. 
    -->

    <!-- 
      An Attribute modifies how an html element behaves.e.g href = "www.youtube.com". The href attribute tells the anchor tag how it should behave. The href is called the Attribute Name while the texts accross the equal-to sign is called the Attribute value. The value must be surrounded by double quotes.
      
      Note that we can have multiple attributes on an element and they are separated with just a space. e.g target = "". The TARGET Attribute determines if the link is going to open in our current page or in a new tab. By default, if we don't have a target attribute, it opens in in the same page.If the target attribute is set to _blank, our link will open in a new tab. <a href = "www.youtube.com" target = "_blank">Link</a> 
      
      Note that the href and target attributes only work on the anchor tag. Other elements have their attributes.


      QUESTION

      Apart from the href and target attributes, what other attributes can be set on an element since he said we can have multiple attributes in one element?
